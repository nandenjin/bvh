## Usage

```javascript
BVH.read(urlForBVHFile, function(motion) {
  // basic infomation about motion data
  motion.frameTime
  motion.numFrames

  // get lists of nodes
  motion.nodeList

  // get a node by id
  var node = motion.of('Head')

  // change node's internal state to n-th frame
  node.at(4)

  // you can exchange the order of method "at" and "of"
  var state = motion.at(4)
  node = state.of('Head')

  // node properties
  node.offsetX
  node.offsetY
  node.offsetZ
  node.rotationX
  node.rotationY
  node.rotationZ

  // node adjacent to "End Site" has properties about endOffset
  if (node.hasEnd) {
    node.endOffsetX
    node.endOffsetY
    node.endOffsetZ
  }
});
```

## Environment

For client-side scripting, we provide `dist/bvh.js`and`dist/bvh.min.js`, both of which are automatically generated by [browserbuild](https://github.com/LearnBoost/browserbuild).
If you need to rebuild them, run `npm install` to install browserbuild as a local module, then run `make`.
